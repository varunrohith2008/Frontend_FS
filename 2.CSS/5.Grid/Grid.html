                    <p>A dashboard is a way of displaying various types of visual data in one place. Usually, a
                        dashboard is intended to convey different, but related information in an easy-to-digest form.
                        And oftentimes, this includes things like key performance indicators (KPI)s or other important
                        business metrics that stakeholders need to see and understand at a glance. Dashboards are useful across different industries and verticals because they’re highly
                        customizable. They can include data of all sorts with varying date ranges to help you
                        understand: what happened, why it happened, what may happen, and what action you should take.
                        And since dashboards use visualizations like tables, graphs, and charts, others who aren’t as
                        close to the data can quickly and easily understand the story it tells or the insights it
                        reveals. </p>
