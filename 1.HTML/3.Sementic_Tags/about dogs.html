            </center>
            <p>Stray dogs are dogs that do not have an owner or live on the streets. They often roam freely in cities,
                towns, and villages, searching for food, shelter, and safety. Many stray dogs face challenges such as
                hunger, illness, injury, and harsh weather conditions. They can sometimes be scared of humans, but with
                care
                and kindness, they can become friendly and loyal companions. <b>Stray dogs also play a role in
                    controlling
                    pests, but if not managed properly, they may create problems like spreading diseases.</b> <strong>It
                    is important for
                    communities to take responsibility by promoting animal welfare, providing shelter, and encouraging
                    adoption
                    so that these dogs can live healthier and happier lives. <button>read more...</button> </strong>

    <h3> Some Good Advantages of Stray dogs</h3>
    <section>
        <p> Stray dogs are highly alert and can act as watchdogs, barking when strangers approach, helping to keep
            neighborhoods safer. They often hunt rats, insects, and other small pests, reducing their population around
            homes and streets. Some stray dogs form bonds with local communities and provide emotional support and
            companionship to people, especially the elderly or those living alone. Stray dogs are highly resilient and
            adaptable, making them a reminder of how animals survive in challenging environments. Their presence
            encourages community-driven initiatives like vaccination, sterilization, and animal welfare programs.</p>
