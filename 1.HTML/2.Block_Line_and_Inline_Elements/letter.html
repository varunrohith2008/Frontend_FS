        <p>I have some fear about coming out of my town because, the places looks new, the surroundings areas are now. So, I feel very uncomfortable after watching my environment surfaces. </p>
        <p>After Several days I practiced their rules and regulations. And <b>I Strongly feel me as an Bold person and I ruin my College days with my friends , Faculties , Lab Assistant's and Workers.</b></p>
